# Module 11 Challenge

### Data Collection (HTML, Splinter, BeautifulSoup) Challenge 
Assignment Submission by: Andrea Aguilar


In Part 1 of this assignment, we utilized Splinter and BeautifulSoup for automated web browsing to acess the Mars news website and extract HTML code. We scraped titles and preview text of news articles and saved this information.

In Part 2 of the assignement, we again used Splinter and BeautfiulSoup to extract an HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame. We then conducted various analyses and created data visualizations to further explore the Mars weather data.
